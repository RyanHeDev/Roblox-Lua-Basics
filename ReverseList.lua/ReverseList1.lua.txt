It loops up to half of the table and for each position in the first half, swaps it with the corresponding position in the second half.
If t is a table with five elements, it would loop over i = 1, 2, meaning it will swap t[1] with t[5] and t[2] with t[4] and that’s all you have to do. (t[3] doesn’t change since it’s the middle value here) Also works with evenly sized arrays.
